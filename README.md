# Text Analysis: Classic vs AI methods
In my final year of my Masters in Mathematics at the University of Bath, I completed a project called *Text Analysis: Classic vs AI methods*.


Covering three core areas of text analysis: classification for sentiment analysis, clustering for topic modelling, and
Large Language Models (LLMS). It involves both theoretical study and practical implementation of various models
on real-world datasets, with the creation of a transformer-based LLM for the task of text summarisation.

### <ins>Models and topics covered:</ins>

**Classification for sentiment analysis**
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression

**Clustering for sentiment analysis**
- K-means
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Stacked and Bidirectional RNNs
- Encoder-Decoder model
- Transformer
